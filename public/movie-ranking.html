<h2>My Top 3 Animes So Far</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Solo Leveling</h3>

<p>
  One of the bangers of the year, you watch sung ji-woo go from below average to
  be nigh undefeatable
</p>

<h3>Black Clover</h3>
<p>
  Highlight of the story, you watch Asta, Yuno and the rest of the cast doing
  mad stuffs
</p>

<h3>Demon Slayers</h3>
<p>Man this was so good!!!!, the graphics, storyline, plot.<br>
This was breath-taking and it was mindblowing
